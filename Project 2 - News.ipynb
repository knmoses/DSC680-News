before themthey can vote for the democrat and prove that they refuse to tolerate an accused child molester and sexual predator being in their party and in the senate or they can put political power over the morality they have long preached aboutin other words they can either put power over principles or put principles over powerthey can t do bothand while they are damned if they do and damned if they don t choosing the latter of those two options would be a far better and more honorable choicesome things go above politics and sexual assault is and rightfully should be one of themvoting for moore for the sake of political power throws every sexual assault victim under the bus it will especially be a slap in the face of women across the country a major voting block that has already been overwhelmingly voting democrat for many yearsif republicans want to have any chance of surviving as a legitimate political party for many more decades to come it is critical that they start by drawing a line in the sand when it comes to moore and the people who defend him such as donald trumpthis starting point alone can restore a little of the respect the gop has lost perhaps then they ll even be courageous enough to rejects the racists and the sexists and the nazis which will do more to grow the ranks of the party than the southern strategy ever didand then the republican party can get past being a haven for extremists and antigovernment zealots and get on the road to becoming a sane party with real ideas instead of simply opposing and obstructing at every turn which has not been good for the country at allamerica has lost its respect of the international community and our reputation has been seriously sullied letting moore step inside the senate would send a message to the world that america supports child molestation and the sexual assault and harassment of womensuch a message from the republican party smacks of hypocrisy after all we are talking about the same party that constantly bring up the sexual assault allegations against bill clintonbut just like how they constantly bring up abraham lincoln in an attempt to claim that the republican party must still be great their rhetoric about bill clinton is old and tired and not really that relevant today the gop is far removed from the days of lincoln and bill clinton was president two decades ago and if he were running today he would not win the sexual assault allegations alone would prevent him from even getting on the ballothowever by supporting donald trump who was accused by a dozen women of sexual assault during the 2016 campaign republicans committed a serious hypocrisy that undermines their bill clinton talking pointif moore wins next month republicans will only be doubling down on that hypocrisy and they ll be past the point of no return and the consequences will be severeamerica is more diverse than ever before women have emerged as a force to be reckoned with after decades of old white guys running the show minorities are also set to become the majority of the population and once that scale tips the gop will no longer be able to be the party of white people it just won t workit s just a matter of time and time is running out for the republican partyand that s why they must rise above politics and stand for something bigger than themselvessexual assault and child molestation should not be rewarded with power and prestige and that should go beyond the political arena as well whether the behavior is coming from a corporate ceo or the partowner of a website or a church leader or any other position of powerrepublicans need to start practicing the  morality  they preach and they can do that by putting politics aside and do the right thingthat s what republicans did in 1860 when they voted for a dark horse candidate as their flagbearer lincoln then put politics aside to assemble one of the greatest cabinets in our history bringing together liberal and conservative republicans and even a democrat or twoand even though lincoln remained neutral at first and the politics of day made it really difficult he made the decision to put politics aside and pushed for the passage of the 13th amendment such a move at the time could have cost lincoln a second term but he did it anywaylincoln put principle over power in the face of an even more contentious

crazy leaders are more alike from outofcontrol hair to ludicrous proclamations trump and kim are like brothers from another deeply disturbed motherwe thought we d take a look at some of the ways the two are alike starting with what we ve already mentioned kim jongun was the undisputed world champion of insanity until right around the middle of trump s run at the presidency here in the united states how could anyone compete with kim s reclamation of one half hour from the japanese on august 15 2015 96 years after the korean dignitary says japan  stole time  from north korea it s hard to keep up with a man who learned to drive at only age threetrump does his best though on day one of his presidency he insisted that it stopped raining just as he began to give his inaugural address   which was news to those in attendance getting wet as it began raining at precisely that moment that same day donald looked out at a crowd roughly half the size of the previous inauguration to take place and declared it  the biggest crowd at any inauguration ever kim is famous for using doctored video to fake missile launches a  show  of his military prowess and resolve trump prefers to lie the oldfashioned way by just making shit up and hoping nobody calls him on it we don t actually have room here for a more complete documentation of all of the outright lies from either toddler tyrant but rest assured that the lists are extensive although their rallies look slightly differentuniforms flowers and colorful dresses line the streets of north korazy poolgettyfans display a makeshift sign made of used beer cases justin merrimangettyin july upon release of the hwasong 14 missile kim who is literally never seen out of uniform reportedly  expressed satisfaction saying it looked as handsome as a goodlooking boy and was well made just one month earlier trump was waxing romantic about his own terrible toys pitching the sale of  beautiful military equipment because nobody makes it like the united states  while he was in the middle east there was no uniform for trump that day but only because he wasn t on an aircraft carrierremember that time kim jongun said  it would be perfect for obama to live with a group of monkeys in the world s largest african natural zoo and lick the breadcrumbs thrown by spectators  through the korean central news agencyi d pretty much put an equals sign between that and the time trump told the former president of trump plaza hotel  casino that  laziness is a trait in blacks frankly that s gross so i m not going to spend a whole lot of time on this entry other than to say that trump s  you can do anything  looks exactly the same to me as kim s  pleasure squad so this one s kind of misleading kim jongun inherited a state media from his dad they pretty much just say whatever he tells them to say and he has the final word on whether anything anyone in his country ever says makes it into print there is no internet for regular citizens in north koreatrump on the other hand is trying to get there by delegitimizing our constitutionallyprotected press and supporting television programming that serves as propagandamaybe you ve heard of some of north korea s brutal executions for  crimes  as petty as falling asleep during an event but do you remember that time donald trump took out fullpage ads in every paper in new york calling for the execution of the  central park five  a group of teenage boys who were coerced into confessing to a rape they didn t commit they were completely exonerated by dna evidence and reimbursed $41 million by the state for their ordeal trump reiterated his belief that the boys then men were guilty as recently as 2016  what were they doing in the park playing checkers  he tweeted a few years back to recap the last four horrid sentences trump wanted the death penalty for a noncapital crime that the people didn t commithow could i forget this one although we don t know the extent of kim jongun s corruption we can make a pretty educated guess based on the fact that like his father before him he lives like a king while the citizens of north korea literally eat sawdust to keep from starvingtrump s corruption however can be more accurately tracked because there are websites dedicated to chronicling it all i would hate to see the internet run out of available pages though so hopefully we get rid of this guy soon in fact he never should have been president in the first place because like all fascists the kim family of course has always been in power in the secretive kingdom but that doesn t stop them from  electing  their leaders   who run unopposed of coursetrump s dark ties to russia however may prove to be the end of his presidency for all the indignity we ve suffered in even allowing donald trump to assume the presidency of the united states we at least still have a constitution and some semblance of democracy and we have something north koreans don t bob muller and a

both history and current events and able to see through trump s thin fa ade of knowitallism and deep into what he is   an ignorant narcissistic and dangerous conmantrump supporters not only don t see this they re happy that there s someone running for president that thinks exactly like them take melanie austin of brownsville pennsylvania she thought her beliefs about obama being a gay muslim from kenya and michelle being transgender were just fringe beliefs   right up until she started hearing similar stuff from trump and other rightwing extremistsnow she knows she s right about all of this you can t tell her that she s ignorant and dumb if she can t figure this out for herself you can t tell her she s delusional you can sit there with her and countless others like her and present facts figures charts studies and more all from the most reputable sources there are and prove that her lord and savior is wrong and you ll still get shot downthere s more to this than the problem of confirmation bias austin gets much of her information from fringe rightwing blogs and conspiracy sites but that s not all of it many of trump s supporters are seriously too dumb to know they re dumb it s called the dunningkruger effect and it s an unshakeable illusion that you re much smarter and more skilled andor knowledgeable than you really arepeople like austin labor under the illusion that their knowledge about things is at least as good as if not better than the actual facts for these people though their knowledge isn t just superior   it s superior even to those who have intimate and detailed knowledge of the subject at hand trump himself has exemplified this countless times such as when he claimed he knows more about isis than even our military generals dohis fans simply take his word for it and believe that because he knows they know they are literally incapable of seeing that they don t knowto be sure the dunningkruger effect is present everyone all across the political spectrum and indeed in every walk of life we all overestimate our abilities and knowledge somewhere however the effect is especially pronounced in people with limited intellectual and social skills people who are unskilled in intellectual and social domains suffer a dual burden not only do these people reach erroneous conclusions and make unfortunate choices but their incompetence robs them of the metacognitive ability to realize it so basically yes it s possible to be too dumb to realize you re dumbin four separate studies people who scored in the bottom quarter on tests involving everything from humor to logic and even to grammar grossly overestimated where they thought they would score they averaged scores in the 12th percentile while their average estimate of their own scores was the 62nd percentilethe researchers attribute that huge discrepancy to a literal inability to distinguish accuracy from error or to put it another way those who are the most lacking in skills and knowledge are the least able to see ittake the case of mcarthur wheeler a man who robbed two banks in 1995 and was caught rather easily he thought he would get away with it because he rubbed his face with lemon juice which is used in invisible ink to test the theory that lemon juice would turn him invisible he rubbed it on his face took a polaroid and his face wasn t in the picture so he thought he was safe from security cameras because he could make his face invisiblehe was shocked when police caught him because of that saying  but i wore the juice  he literally couldn t see the ridiculousness of that line of thought david dunning one of the first to catalog the dunningkruger effect hence its name has studied human behavior including voter behavior for decades he penned an oped in politico that explains why this effect is so pronounced in trump s supporters it suggests that some voters especially those facing significant distress in their life might like some of what they hear from trump but they do not know enough to hold him accountable for the serious gaffes he makes they fail to recognize those gaffes as missteps  again the key to the dunningkruger effect is not that unknowledgeable voters are uninformed it is that they are often misinformed their heads filled with false data facts and theories that can lead to misguided conclusions held with tenacious confidence and extreme partisanship perhaps some that make them nod in agreement with trump at his rallies trump is completely inept and his supporters are way too poorlyinformed to know that he s
